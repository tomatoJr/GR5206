# HW1: tibble ordering
#
# 1. Convert the dataset `mtcars` to a tibble `t1`.
# 2. Copy `t1` into a tibble `t2` and delete the columns 'drat' and 'am'.
# 3. Copy `t2` into a tibble `t3` and permute the column 'mpg' and 'qsec' (hint : you might want to use the function `which`).
# 4. Select the 10 rows of `t3` with lowest 'qsec' and copy them into a tibble `t4` in increasing order.
